# java-fundamentals

# Lab 2

- Created multiple classes and tests for each one as designated per instruction
- IntelliJ was key to success which ultimately relies on the gradle being set-up properly

# Lab 3

- Created the first method for weather
- IntelliJ has been fixed and gradle works as expected
- Linter created for this lab
- When it runs, the linter should keep the code written within a strict set of parameters to help write clear and concise code now and ing   the future when using IntelliJ

# Lab 4
- Serge's Repo contains our work which can be found below:

# Lab 6
## Part 1
- I worked with Serge today on this lab and used online resources as well
- Create a restaurant class
- Created a review class
- Create the review class about a restaurant
- Lastly added an add review 
- Did not get to stretch goals

## Part 2
- I created new classes for shop, theater, and theater review
- In conjunction with those classes, I created test for each
- I refactored the existing code show data could be shared across via inheritance
- Tests all checked out and really found out how much Java hates differing spaces between messages (expected and actual)
